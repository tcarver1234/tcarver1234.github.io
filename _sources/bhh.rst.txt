Black Hole Hunter
==================

We will be following this tutorial: `Hungry Shark <https://youtu.be/UCVbX38FjaI>`_

Don't forget to make it space themed! For example your main character could be a black-hole searching for stars to eat and grow!

Find a simple example `here <https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/490244861>`_

Step 1 : Make Sprites
---------------------

* Choose a Predator sprite. 

Click on the cat icon to make a new sprite. This will be you hunting character. For example a Black Hole.

* Choose a Prey sprite.

  This is what the predator will eat to grow and get points. For example stars or planets. 


* Choose a backdrop.

  This will be the background, for example space. 


Step 2 : Program Predator Sprite
--------------------------------

* Drag your predator sprite where you want it to start. 

* Click on the yellow event tab. Drag the block "When Green Flag clicked" onto your coding space. This will tell your sprite code when to start. 

* To test your game at any time just click on the green flag. To stop click to red dot next to it. 
 
* To get your sprite move towards the mouse: go to blue motion tab:
  drag: Point towards (mouse-pointer)
  drag: move (10) steps. 
  edit: 10 -> 4 steps. 

* This will only move sprite once. To make the sprite follow the mouse:
  drag: forever loop. and place around both movement options.

Step 3 : Program Prey sprites
-----------------------------

* Drag your prey sprite to where you want it to start. 

* Drag: event block "When green flag clicked", to start sprite. 

* To be eaten by predator: drag "if () then () " loop from control. Place under the event block. 
  
* Go to sensing and select "touching () " and drag this into the "if" loop. Choose the name of your predator in the drop down box. 

* In the if loop drag the look block "hide" so that the prey hides after touching the predator. 

* To make this happen at any time you must drag the forever loop from control and place it around the if loop.
