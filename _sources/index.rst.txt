Out of this World  GameJam!
===================================

We will be spending the day making our own Space themed games using scratch. 

You can make any game you like but there are step-by-step guides through 2 different types of scratch games you can use to base your own special game on. 

At the end of the day don't forget to submit your game in order to win a prize!
