Asteroid Blaster
================

We are following this tutorial : `Space Invaders <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N033rFSELE&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=Hackingtons>`_

Remember you can make the game as different as you want. This tutorial is designed to show you what you can do with a scratch game. 

Don't forget the space theme!



Step 1 : Making Sprites
------------------------

There are 3 main ways to make a sprite:

* Choose an existing sprite

* Upload a sprite image. 
  You can upload an image you have from before, or one from our shared `folder <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Kjgot_vzDHXU1a0WQGkCPpA4yH43taxl?usp=sharing>`_ 
 
* Paint your own sprite. 

Pick which of these you want by hovering over the sprite button (the cat).

Step 2 : Moving your sprites
----------------------------

You can tell the sprite :

* Where to start

* Where to move

* When to move

* What to follow

You do this using the blue "motion" blocks.

Step 3 : Making a blaster
-------------------------

To shoot objects you need to make a new sprite. This sprite will be the bullet/ball/blast. 

You need to tell this sprite:

* When to appear (show/clone)

* When to disapear (hide/delete)

* What to do when it touches another sprite.

Step 4 : Cloning your sprites
------------------------------

If you want to have many sprites which act the same way by using the same code then you need to clone them.

If you want to control you sprites with the mouse button find the (mouse) option in sensing.

Step 5 : Enemy sprites
------------------------

In order to make the game a challenge you need obstacles. These obstacles make it harder for you to win and can even destroy you to end the game.

Step 6 : Starting in a random position
--------------------------------------

If you want an element of surprise get your prizes or enemies to appear in random positions.

Step 7 : Destroying sprites
----------------------------

If you want to destroy enemy sprites, or be destroyed by enemy. 

You can do this using the show/hide blocks or delete clone blocks if your sprite is a clone.

Step 8 : Game Over
-------------------

To stop your game carrying on forever you need to have an end screen.

You can do this by creating a sprite to say "Game Over" or "You have Won!"
